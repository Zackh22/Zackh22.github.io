# Zachary Hammes's Portfolio
Hi, I am Zack Hammes. I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Computer Sceince and minor in Applied Statistics. I chose to major in Computer Science because coding is like building a puzzle. As you code, get to see all the lttle bits and pieces come together to form one great project. Once it's complete, you feel this sense of accomplishment, which is what I strive for. In this portfolio, you will find my resume, projects I have worked on, and any other important links.
